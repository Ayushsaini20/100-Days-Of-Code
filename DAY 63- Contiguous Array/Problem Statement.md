## Contiguous Array

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
