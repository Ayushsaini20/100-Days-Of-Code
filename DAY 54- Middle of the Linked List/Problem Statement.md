## Middle of the Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:

<img width="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Ayushsaini20/100-Days-Of-Code/assets/73630171/92465911-d3bd-48a6-8788-65f9b55dfcd5">


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
